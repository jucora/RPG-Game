## :pencil: Main Description

This project is a RPG spaceship game. This game was built in Phaser 3, a framework for Javascript focused on videogames development. The main objective of this project is to apply all the concepts learned in the Javascript cycle as part of the Microverse curriculum. In this project the use of webpack for content management is applied, as well as the use of modules, modern Javascript syntax, the application of POO through the use of classes, inheritance and more.

## :point_right: How the game was design and developed

- The first step was to learn the framework Phaser, read the documentation, make some practices to get familiar with it and study the main functionalities offered by this tool.
- The second step was to really understand what RPG means and try to see some examples and get some ideas. This was the most fundamental part. I spent some time reading about video games story
- Once the second step was finished, an idea was generated in which all the programming concepts learned could be applied both in javascript and in Phaser.
- When the idea was conceived, a story is generated to try to place the player in a game context. A goal is established, and also the task to make a relation between each step in the game with the application of programming concepts in javascript was made.
- Having the main idea of the game, the story, and the whole tasks in mind, I proceed to search for resources for the video game, such as sprites, sounds, background images, animations, documentation with code examples and all necessary resources to make the video game. It is important to mention that the resources used for this video game are freely distributed in order to protect and respect copyright.
- Then the video game creation process began and at this point of development the ideas were implemented, and over time some of them were also discarded and new ones emerged.
